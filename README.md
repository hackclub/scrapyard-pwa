# Summit PWA

This is a Next.js web app that: collects additional information from participants, generates tickets, and has a schedule for participants to reference.

Here's the tech it uses:

* Next.js
* Airtable (where we store all the information about attendees!)
* Vercel KV (storing session data)
* Fillout (form software used for collecting additional information)
